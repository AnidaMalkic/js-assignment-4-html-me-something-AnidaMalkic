            <h2>Srebrenica During War</h2>
            <p>
               "Srebrenica is a town in eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina. The town’s name is derived from the Bosnian word
               srebro, meaning “silver.” Rich deposits of silver and lead discovered in the surrounding mountains led to
               the town’s founding in 1387 as a mining centre. Lead and zinc mining remain important. A health resort
               with thermal springs is located in nearby Crni Guber. In the 20th century its population was largely
               Muslim, with a significant Serbian minority.
               During the Bosnian war between Bosniaks (formerly designated as Muslims) and Bosnian Serbs in the 1990s,
               the town was declared a “safe area” for Bosniaks by the United Nations. In July 1995, however, Bosnian
               Serbs laid siege to the town and systematically massacred at over 8000 Bosniak men and boys. Several
               Bosnian Serbs were later convicted of war crimes by a UN tribunal at The Hague, Neth., for their role in
               the Srebrenica massacre.
               This small mountain town that came to international prominence as a result of events during the Bosnian
               War (1992–1995). Fifty years after the world said “Never Again” to the horrors of the Holocaust, genocide
               took place on European soil, preciselly in this small town of Srebrenica. The name Srebrenica has become
               synonymous with those dark days in July 1995 when, in the first ever United Nations declared safe area,
               thousands of men and boys were systematically murdered and buried in mass graves. The victims, who were
               Muslim, were selected for death on the basis of their identity. This was the worst atrocity on European
               soil since the Second World War."

            <h2>Execution of Bosniaks in Srebrenica</h3>
               <p>
                  Beginning in 1992, Bosnian Serb forces targeted Srebrenica in a campaign to seize control of a block
                  of territory in eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina. Their eventual goal was to annex this territory to the
                  adjacent republic of Serbia (which, along with Montenegro, constituted the rump of the Yugoslav
                  federation). To do so, they believed, required the expulsion of the territory’s Bosniak inhabitants,
                  who opposed annexation. In March 1995 Radovan Karadžić, president of the self-declared autonomous
                  Republika Srpska (Bosnian Serb Republic), directed his military forces to “create an unbearable
                  situation of total insecurity with no hope of further survival or life for the inhabitants of
                  Srebrenica.” A cordon of Bosnian Serb soldiers had imposed an embargo on food and other supplies that
                  provoked most of the town’s Bosniak fighters to flee the area. In late June, after some skirmishes
                  with the few remaining Bosniak fighters, the Bosnian Serb military command formally ordered the
                  operation, code-named Krivaja 95, that culminated in the massacre.
                  On 8 March 1995, Radovan Karadžić ordered the Serb Forces to eliminate the Muslim enclaves of
                  Srebrenica and Žepa, escalating the “strategic objectives” of 12 May 1992. On 2 July 1995, Bosnian
                  Serb Forces attacked the Srebrenica enclave. This attack on the enclave continued until 11 July 1995,
                  when Ratko Mladić and the Bosnian Serb Forces entered Srebrenica. Subsequently, those Bosnian Serb
                  Forces terrorised Bosnian Muslims, who were forcibly transferred to areas outside the enclave and many
                  of whom fled in a huge column through the woods towards Tuzla (a free territory). The vast majority of
                  this group consisted of civilians. Over 8,000 Bosnian Muslim prisoners captured in the area around
                  Srebrenica were summarily executed from 13 July to 19 July 1995.
                  The offensive commenced on July 6, 1995, with Bosnian Serb forces advancing from the south and burning
                  Bosniak homes along the way. Amid chaos and terror, thousands of civilians fled Srebrenica for the
                  nearby village of Potočari, where a contingent of about 200 Dutch peacekeepers was stationed. Some of
                  the Dutch surrendered, while others withdrew; none fired on the advancing Bosnian Serb forces. On July
                  11, Bosnian Serb military leader Ratko Mladić strolled through Srebrenica and, in a statement recorded
                  on film by a Serb journalist, said, “We give this town to the Serb nation…The time has come to take
                  revenge on the Muslims.”
                  On the night of July 11, a column of more than 10,000 Bosniak men set off from Srebrenica through
                  dense forest in an attempt to reach safety. Beginning the following morning, Bosnian Serb officers
                  used UN equipment and made false promises of security to encourage the men to surrender; thousands
                  gave themselves up or were captured, and many were subsequently executed. Other Bosniaks were forced
                  out of Potočari that day through the use of terror, including individual murders and rapes committed
                  by Bosnian Serb forces. The women, children, and elderly were placed aboard buses (some of which had
                  been brought from Serbia) and driven to Bosniak-held territory. The men and boys were taken on July 12
                  and 13 to various holding sites, mostly in Bratunac.
                  Some killings occurred on the evening of July 12, but mass evacuations of mostly blindfolded Bosniak
                  males to execution sites began in earnest on the evening of July 13. The destinations were primarily
                  north of Srebrenica, in a 35-mile- (55-km-) long band alongside the Drina River, which marks much of
                  Bosnia’s border with Serbia. They included a football field in Bratunac, several meadows and fields
                  near Vlasenica and Nova Kasaba, a warehouse in Kravica, a factory in Karakaj, a school in Orahovac, a
                  dirt road in the Cerska Valley, and a cultural centre in Pilica. The executions continued at least
                  through July 16, when hundreds of people were reportedly shot at a state farm in the village of
                  Branjevo. Although Bosnian Serb forces were primarily responsible for the killings, a police unit from
                  Serbia was recorded on video participating in the execution of six Bosniaks. It was discovered later
                  that many of the victims of the massacre had had their arms and feet bound. Many of the bodies also
                  showed signs of mutilation.
                  The total number of men and boys who were slaughtered was initially a matter of some debate. Under
                  heavy international pressure, the government of the Republika Srpska (which, after the conflict,
                  formally became a constituent part of Bosnia and Herzegovina) issued an apology in 2004 for the
                  “enormous crimes” in Srebrenica and acknowledged that an estimated 7,800 had perished. Although not
                  all sources agreed with that figure, it was generally accepted that at least 7,000 people were killed,
                  and some estimates placed the toll at more than 8,000.
                  The process of locating the graves and identifying the victims was complicated by a well-organized
                  effort undertaken by Bosnian Serb forces in September and October 1995 to hide traces of the
                  Srebrenica crimes. Soldiers used heavy tractors and backhoes to dig up mass graves and moved the
                  disinterred remains to distant sites, many of which were later located by U.S. intelligence experts
                  using satellite photographs. It required years of analysis by Western scientists—using laborious
                  comparisons of soil and tissue samples, shell casings, pollen, and clothing fragments—to piece
                  together exactly where the killings had occurred and how the bodies had been moved among an estimated
                  80 mass grave sites. By early 2010 the International Commission on Missing Persons, a nongovernmental
                  organization established in 1996, had used DNA samples to identify more than 6,400 individual victims.
